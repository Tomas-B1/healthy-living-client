In todays world everyone is so busy, and its hard to keep track of certain things. With Healthy Living it makes it easier to find workouts and meals to save you some time in your evereyday lives. Users can sign up and save workouts to their scheduled day along with finding healthy meals to cook for dinner that night.

Healthy Living verifies the user with the login feature for existence in the database. Then the users can search through workouts for multiple body types and save them in the schedule that is its own database so they have it saved for future days for reference.

Functionality and testing:
The current front end project uses a subset of the data from the backend database. See the full backend database at (see https://github.com/Tomas-B1/healthy-living-backend).

For test examples signup with name, email and password. You will then be redirected to the login page where you can log in. Once logged in you can explore the website by viewing workouts and saving them to your selected day, also you can view the multiple meals with the ingredients and directions also provided to you.
Design is a responsive layout and can be used on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
